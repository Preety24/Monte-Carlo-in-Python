# Monte-Carlo-in-Python
In Monte Carlo Simulation, we studied probability distribution using random variables. We plotted histogram and tried to change edge color, number of bins, number of trials and values of high and low in both uniform and normal random generator. We worked on random transformation and saw the changes in outcome by using normal, function and changing number of bins. We then estimated the value of pi using hit and miss method. In this, we scattered points in the figure, changed interval and observed the corresponding changes in graph. We also solved the given pudding problem and calculated the selling price of pudding at the given minimum profit. We then worked on single integral and calculated area under the curve. At last we worked on double integral.
